## 📖 Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive framework for implementing **reinforcement learning (RL)** techniques to achieve **optimal quantum state discrimination** over unknown channels. The codebase enables real-time calibration and optimization of quantum devices—particularly **coherent-state receivers**—without requiring prior knowledge of system parameters.

### 🎯 The Challenge

Quantum devices are particularly challenging to operate: their functionality relies on precisely tuning parameters, yet environmental conditions constantly shift, causing detuning. Traditional approaches require detailed modeling of environmental behavior, which is often computationally unaffordable, while direct parameter measurements introduce extra noise.

### 💡 Our Solution

We frame quantum receiver calibration as a **reinforcement learning problem**, where an agent learns optimal discrimination strategies through trial and error—without any prior knowledge of experimental details.

## 🧮 Mathematical Framework

### Coherent State Discrimination

The goal is to discriminate between coherent states |±α⟩ using a Kennedy-like receiver with displacement β:

```
P(n|α) = exp(-|α|²) · δₙ₀ + (1 - exp(-|α|²)) · δₙ₁
```

The **success probability** for a given displacement β:

```
Pₛ(β) = ½ Σₙ max_{s∈{-1,+1}} P(n | sα + β)
```

### Q-Learning Update Rules

**Action-value updates:**
```
Q₁(β, n, g) ← Q₁(β, n, g) + α · [r - Q₁(β, n, g)]
Q₀(β) ← Q₀(β) + α · [max_g Q₁(β, n, g) - Q₀(β)]
```

**Policy (ε-greedy):**
```
π(β) = { random      with probability ε
       { argmax Q₀   with probability 1-ε
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/matibilkis/qrec.git
cd qrec

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from qrec.utils import *

# Initialize Q-tables with 25 discretized β values
betas_grid, [q0, q1, n0, n1] = define_q(nbetas=25)

# Find model-aware optimal (for comparison)
mmin, p_star, beta_star = model_aware_optimal(betas_grid, alpha=0.4)

# Run Q-learning episode
hidden_phase = np.random.choice([0, 1])  # Nature chooses ±α
indb, beta = ep_greedy(q0, betas_grid, ep=0.01)  # Agent chooses β
n = give_outcome(hidden_phase, beta, alpha=0.4)  # Photon detection
indg, guess = ep_greedy(q1[indb, n, :], [0, 1], ep=0.01)  # Agent guesses
reward = give_reward(guess, hidden_phase)  # Success/failure
```

### Running Experiments

```bash
# Navigate to experiment directory
cd experiments/5

# Run change-point experiment with optimal parameters
python change_point.py
```

## 📈 Results

The RL agent successfully learns near-optimal receiver configurations:

| Experiment | Configuration | Key Finding |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| 0 | ε = 1.0 (full exploration) | Baseline uniform sampling |
| 1 | ε = 0.01, lr = 1/N | Convergent but slow adaptation |
| 2 | Change-point, lr = 1/N | **Cannot adapt** to α changes |
| 3 | ε = 0.01, lr = 0.005 | Stable but slow learning |
| 4 | ε = 0.01, lr = 0.05 | Good balance |
| 5 | Change-point, lr = 0.05 | **Successful re-calibration** ✓ |

> 💡 **Key Insight:** Fixed learning rates enable adaptation to changing channel conditions, while decaying rates (1/N) lock the agent to initial configurations.
